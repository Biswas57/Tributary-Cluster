    - Show Commands
    - Delete Commands (nothing)
    - Create Commands
    - Update Commands
    - Parallel Commands

2. Change Error Messages to Exceptions
    - idk how this will affect the system, maybe I have to catch to catch the error in the Springboot application
3. Build spring boot App with the same number of endpoints as CLI commands
