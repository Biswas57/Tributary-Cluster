## Project Overview
Modern software often relies on many small microservices that work together to provide a complete application. Event-driven architecture (EDA) makes up much of the backbone of modern software which microservices rely upon to run smoothly. In essence, EDA is a system with 2 sets of nodes &rarr; event sources (Producers) and event handlers (Consumers). 

This library is based on a heavily simplified version of the event streaming infrastructure [**Apache Kafka**](https://kafka.apache.org/). A quick read of Kafka's design and purpose is recommended to understand the basis and workings of this project, a brief video to understand what Kafka is can be found [**here**](https://youtu.be/vHbvbwSEYGo).

The fundamental premise on which Event-Driven Architecture rests is the ability of producer and consumer entities in the system to share data asynchronously via a stream-like channel, in other words, a Tributary-like platform. Our library enhances the traditional in-memory EDA, which often relies on a single message queue shared by multiple consumers, potentially causing bottlenecks and delays. By adopting a log-based approach, we overcome the limitations of message replay and memory storage seen in in-memory message brokers. This improvement enhances data storage, replayability, and adds greater functionality to message processing, enabling more efficient and flexible handling of events across multiple channels.

## Breakdown of Engineering Requirements
**NOTE:** A complete visual overview of the entire system exist, showcasing the system in the [**final UML Diagram**](Blogging&Design/UML_final_design.pdf) and a more extensive overview of the capabilities, constrains and functionality of the system can be found in the [**Engineering Requirements**](Engineering_Requirements.md)

### CLI Commands and Usability Testing
To run usability tests on your solution I needed to develop a way to interact with tributaries, producers, and consumers via a command line interface. To do so, I coded a wrapper class called `TributaryCLI` that allows the user to input commands that create, modify, and interact with a tributary cluster system.

        <li>
          <code>type</code> is the type of event that goes through the topic.
          While this can be any type in Java, for the purposes of the CLI it can
          either be <code>Integer</code> or <code>String</code>.
